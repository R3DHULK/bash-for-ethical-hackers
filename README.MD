<h1><b> What is Ethical Hacking? </h1></b>
<h2><i> The term hacking goes a long way back. To be exact, it all started at the Railroad Club of MIT, where both the term â€˜hackingâ€™ and â€˜hackerâ€™ were first coined. Itâ€™s been almost 50 years now, and hacking has evolved into a discipline in the current day and age. With the increase in awareness regarding data protection and data privacy, hacking has been deemed as an illegal activity today. If caught, thereâ€™s a good chance that you will be prosecuted for quite some time depending on the degree of harm caused.

None the less, to protect themselves from hackers of all sorts, employment of Ethical Hackers has become a common practice amongst organizations. Ethical hackers are given the responsibility of finding and fixing security flaws for a certain organization before black hat hackers find them. </h2></i><br>

<h1><b>What Is a Scripting Language? How Does a Scripting Language Differ From a Programming Language?</h1></b>
<h2><i>A scripting language is a variant type of programming language which doesnâ€™t need compilers to execute. Those who are not from a programming background may not understand the statement. Let us break it for non-programmers.

To understand what a scripting language makes different from a programming language. Programming language needs a special type of utility called a compiler to run a program. Before a program runs, the compiler does pre-execution checks and converts the program to machine code. Then machine code will be sent to the runtime environment for execution. On the other hand, scripting languages just interpret the written code line by line and directly send the code to the runtime environment tor execution without compiling it.</h2></i><br>

#
<h1><b>Why Are Scripting Languages Suitable for Hackers and Pentesters Than Programming Languages?</h1></b>
<h2><i>Most of the scripting languages are interpreted. Scripting languages can be run without compiling them. This feature lets hackers and pentesters directly run their scripts on the victim without compilers. Another reason would be because scripts are light to run and transfer to the target machine. In addition to those, another feature that gives the upper hand is execution time. Scripting languages are faster in execution. It can be easily weaponized; All this makes scripting language a perfect programming language for hackers and pentesters.

We have covered the six most commonly usedÂ programming languages by hackersÂ and pentesters in another article. However, we are going to cover the six most common scripting languages for hackers and pentesters in this article. However, we are not assigning any rank to all these scripting languages. We believe each language has developed with unique features. Please donâ€™t consider the language placed in first is the most important than the placed at the sixth position. Letâ€™s start with Bash scripting language.</h2></i><br>

#
<h1><b>Why Bash?</h1></b>
<h2><i>Bash is the most popular and powerful scripting language in Unix and Linux systems. Itâ€™s been widely used by administrators to manage everyday tasks. Basically, Bash is a set of Linux commands used to perform pretty much anything like automating repetitive tasks, scheduling admin jobs, running health checks on the Linux servers, updating patcher on multiple servers at once, etc. In addition to these, it can also be used with other utilities to build productive scripts, which can help administrators carry out difficult tasks. All these powerful features of Bash script didnâ€™t leave hackers and pentesters gaining attention to Bash scripting. Hackers and Pentesters found this as a great tool to perform hacking or pentesting the system. Because Bash can be used with other networks, hacking tools, and programming languages to deliver the payload to the target, it helps exfilleting the data from the victim and create a remote executable application.</h2></i><br>
